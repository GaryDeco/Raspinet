About Network Profiles:
(scroll using down arrow on keyboard)

Network profiles are neccessary in order 
to distinguish one network from another.
when a profile is created, a new report 
directory is created under that profile 
name. All scans and reports conducted 
under that profile are saved to that 
directory. It is up to the user to ensure 
the correct profile is used for the 
network being analyzed. If it is 
incorrect, the reporting will be 
corrupted/inaccurate. Please use caution. 

Creating a new profile:

Select option 2, and type in a single string.
If the name exists, you can switch to it,
if it does not exist, you can add it as a 
new profile or exit to return to the menu.
Your new profile wil be switched to auto-
matically upon creation.
